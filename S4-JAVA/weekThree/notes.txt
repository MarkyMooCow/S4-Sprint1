Started with Rectangle class 

A static method belongs to the class and not to any particular object

If you see anything underlined in your uml diagram that means it is a static variable 

“Read only” in your uml(unified modelling language) class diagram means that the variable is “final” 

Method overloading is when your class has a method with the same name but with different parameters, 
the method can have the same name but there has to be different functionality, you can’t have 2 no argument
constructors for instance. You can have as many overloaded methods as you want but they must all have 
different parameters.
