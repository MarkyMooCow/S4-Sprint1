Constuctor is a special method that gets invoked "automatically" at the time
of object creaation

constructor is used to create objects 

There are three types of constructors
1. default constructor - if you don't add any constructor 
2. parameterized = when we pass argumetns to the constructor 
3. copy constructor - a constructor that recoeves an object and if it is a copy
   constructor it means ot is recieving a constructor of the same type 

Getters and Setters

OOP - object oriented programming, Java is an object oriented programming language 

The behaviour of objects os modified by methods, objects are a function of “classes”

Classes are considered the blueprint of your code, when a function of the class gets used 
or instantiated it becomes an object 

To build a class we need to write down all the attributes and methods of a student 

Attributes includes any of the parts of the class I.e. name, age, RdNo. For a student 

Name: String, Age: Int, RdNo: String nothing exists for real until we create its object 

Access Modifiers: private, public, protected, default

OOP - Encapsulation and Abstraction

Object Aggregation = creating an instance one class as a reference in another class.
Aggregation creates a “has a” relationship between objects, aggregation (a whole
Part relationship os a represented by a line with a clear diamond
