The final keyword prevents any changes being made to its value 

Variables should be declared as fields(member variable, instance variables) only if they are going to be used more then once in the class, used in multiple methods 

Three ways to call a method
1. Using a method name by itself to call another method of the same class 
2. Using a variate that contains a reference to an object, followed by a dot (.) and the method name to call a method of the referenced object 
3. Using the class name and a dot(.)to call a static method of a class 

Scope of field is class 

Scope of a parameter variable declaration is the body of the method which the declaration appears 

If a local variable or parameter in a method has the same name as a field of the class, the field is “hidden” until the block terminates execution - this is called shadowing 

If you want to use the class fields in a method that has local variables with the same name you use use the this. In front of it so the compiler knows which is the instance variable and which is the local 

When an if statement has only one line you don’t need to use the curly braces, if you want two statements to be connected to the if condition then you need the curly braces.
